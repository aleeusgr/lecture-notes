Abstraction, [Composition](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Composition.html), [Identity](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=identity).

#### Abstraction
Formal systems, language, constraints. 
Primitives: objects and morphisms
When we think of objects, we think spatially, and when we think of morphisms, we think more in terms of relationship and movement.
Objects have no properties, and morphisms have beginning and end. 
and function is an example of a morphism. 
This whole theory can be though of as graph theory but more abstract.

Abstraction, composibility, Identity;
Associativity;
Get rid of unnecessary details.  
Generalisation, when you abstract, distant things become similar.  
identity is not trivial.  
Homomorphic type theory.  

the most known example of a category is a `function` on a set. Finite map;
type and set are used interchangeably sometimes. 
In mathematics, `function` is [[pure]] and total. It is defined for any argument.
Purity is not trivial, ⚠️
Can I memoise it? 
What are building blocks?


### Function 
1. Relation: a subset of the set of all pairs of elements in domain and codomain.
2. a function is a special type of relation, one or several elements in the domain can be related to one element in the codomain. Function has one output.
3. A function is directional, it somehow represents entropy and there is no way to undo it. An inverse of a function is a special kind of function. Isomorphism
4. Isomorphism implies two coditions: injection and surjection.
